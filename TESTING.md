# Criteria justification
## coverage       (look at all different use cases and edge cases)
* used snapshot testing in AddQuestion.test to add some credibility to my tests, and make sure they aren't just following broken code.
## clarity        (well commented and code isn't overly complex)
* uh
## designed well  (logical ordering of tests, avoid any tests that aren't necessary or don't add any meaningful value)
* uh
